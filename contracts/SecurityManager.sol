/**
 * @title SecurityManager 
 * 
 * A contract which provides AccessControl (role-based security) for one or more other contracts. 
 * 
 * This contract itself offers generic role-based security. When associated with another contract (the managed 
 * contract, which holds a reference to this contract's address), the managed contract manages its own security 
 * by calling this contract's hasRole function. Then security for that contract is managed by using this contract's
 * grantRole, revokeRole, and renounceRole functions. 
 * 
 * This contract can manage security for multiple contracts at once.
